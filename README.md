# WebGL-Boiler-Plate

This is boiler plate code similar to my OpenGL boiler plate repo, and is intended to be a way to quickly create new WebGL projects. 
It comes with a camera, required math libraries and a collection of useful utility funcitons which will be added to over time.

Things to note: 
* The title and canvas ID can be changed in index.html
* New files must be added as a source file in index.html
* This structure is intended for 3D rendering applications, so those will be the settings used
